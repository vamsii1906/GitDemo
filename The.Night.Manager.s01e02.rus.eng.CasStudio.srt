3
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,787
Mum? What do you want?

4
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,840
I didn't think you'd pick up.

5
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,342
Listen, you know the deal.

6
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,545
I call you. You don't call me here.

7
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,680
You're ashamed to talk to me?

8
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:25,990
Listen, I don't have time to
talk to you. I'm going out.

9
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,706
- Where you going?
- It doesn't matter.

10
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,222
Some... Somewhere on the island.

11
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:33,457
How's the weather there? Just fine?

12
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,366
How's Billy?

13
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,014
As if you care.

14
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,607
They say he doesn't even
ask about you any more.

15
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,100
There's more money coming
at the end of the month.

16
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,826
That's why you called me, right?

17
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,700
I'm putting the phone down.

18
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:54,599
Just remember one thing, honey.

19
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,820
You're nothing but a dirty whore.

20
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,140
Just a minute...

21
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,820
Come in.

22
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,640
Danny. I thought you were your father.

23
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,392
Dad says we need to go.

24
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:25,485
I know, I'm coming.

25
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,835
- You just wait outside.
- Oh.

26
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,860
OK.

27
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,170
_

28
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,940
- How do I look?
- You look very pretty.

29
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,240
Come on...

30
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,700
Go!

31
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,819
I misunderstood him.

32
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,259
The fact remains, you
and paella do not get on,

33
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,368
to the point where basically
we're out seven million,

34
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:04,075
because Corky doesn't like paella.

35
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,363
That's one version, Chief.

36
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:07,699
What do you mean that's one
version? That is the version!

37
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,819
It's a matter of record.

38
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,614
You chaps better go on ahead, I think.

39
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:13,765
- Truly is some of the most exquisite food...
- There you are!

40
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,379
Starting to think you'd
drowned in the bath.

41
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,023
Baby, I have terrible news.

42
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,914
I have a new date for tonight.

43
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,226
He's young, and he's seriously hot.

44
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,011
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.

45
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,432
All right, come on.
Let's go, I'm starving.

46
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:28,964
- You going to come with me, Dans?
- OK.

47
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,432
- All right.
- Are we taking the boats?

48
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:33,099
Yes, we are, sir. You might
even drive if you're lucky.

49
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,269
Yes, you lot. Follow me.

50
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,500
Whee!

51
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,339
- Hello.
- Nice to see you!

52
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,552
- For me too. Hi.
- Hi.

53
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,546
Jorge, how are you?

54
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,357
- Good to see you.
- Mr Roper, how are you?

55
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,544
Very well, thank you.

56
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,146
Are you still doing the shellfish soup?

57
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,373
Yes, of course!

58
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,179
The recipe lives on.

59
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,419
We'll have that to start.

60
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,810
All except for Major Corkoran,
who will have the paella.

61
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,595
Hi there, how are you?

62
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,290
Very good to see you.
Hi, darling, how are you?

63
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,085
Fine.

64
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,939
Good to see you, are you
well? Good to see you again.

65
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,019
I think it is mad, no, I think
it's actually hypocritical

66
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,420
that if you like eating venison,
you ought to be able to kill a stag.

67
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,381
- I think if you're willing to kill a stag...
- Hey, Danny,

68
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:57,738
- ...you have to be willing
- want some of this?

69
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,414
to admit you just like killing stags.

70
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,339
Thank you Jed, I now officially love you.

71
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,249
Chief, is it OK to baptise the
princeling in the ways of the grape?

72
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,155
I think that's a yes. Isn't it?

73
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,116
Dicky, will you please tell
Jed I don't have blood lust?

74
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,028
- Beautiful...
- I don't!

75
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:18,019
- Beautiful, beautiful fizzy liquid.
- You've got so many lusts, Sandy.

76
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,225
That's why we love you. Isn't it?

77
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,739
Give the stag an M16,
Sandy, then I'm interested.

78
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:24,515
GIVE him an M16? Bollocks!

79
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,899
Christ, sell him.

80
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,699
Oh, he likes it.

81
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,940
What do you think, Daniel?

82
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,419
He likes it.

83
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,379
- Oh, dear!
- See what you've done!

84
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,819
What if he turns out like me, boss?

85
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,059
I can see this as a...

86
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,619
This is a dark, dark
road you've embarked upon.

87
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,779
Thank you, Corky.

88
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,299
Yes. What do you want to do?

89
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,099
- You want to...
- That is really good.

90
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,668
- What do you think?
- Get on!

91
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:47,856
All right, all right, all right.

92
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,060
Go on, then.

93
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,739
Come on. Did you like the wine?

94
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,299
Where we going?

95
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,921
- It's a secret.
- Where are you going?

96
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:59,092
You drink my wine, you steal my woman.

97
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:02,815
Proud of you, Danny.

98
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,640
Bring her back in one piece will you?

99
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:08,842
- Lord Langbourne is a snob, basically.
- What?

100
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,499
Three generations of Eton
or you're not on the map.

101
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,241
I'm only one generation, Sandy.
So what does that make me?

102
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,070
You're paying the bill,
Dicky. Which means...

103
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,390
you are the map.

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,672
To Ricardo!

105
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:23,132
Cheers. Good health.

106
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,259
Slimy bloody arse-licking creep.

107
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,120
Excuse me, small person, out of my way.

108
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:59,988
May I have this dance?

109
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:03,340
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

110
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,611
Right, let's see what you've
got. OK, OK, that's fine,

111
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:09,290
that's fine. And again,
and round... Very good.

112
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,419
Chief, I think she wants to dance.

113
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,179
Go on, then, Corkoran.

114
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,539
Right, come on, I'll do it.

115
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,940
Tear it up, tear it up!

116
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,694
Oh, yeah. Come on, baby!

117
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,164
...and right, and left, that's it!

118
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,795
- It's time to put the children to bed.
- Oh, no, I hate children.

119
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,466
Thank you, great dancing.

120
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:35,465
- Guys, goodnight, sleep well.
- Come on, ignore it.

121
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,100
Dance with me!

122
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,759
...if you had Chateaubriand
every single day,

123
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:42,206
there'd no point at which you'd go,

124
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,006
"Oh, for God's sake..." I give
up, were you born on sirloin?

125
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,271
No.

126
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:49,411
Corky has smelt the...

127
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,008
Nobody move! Nobody move!

128
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,363
This is a robbery.

129
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,788
Guns down! Guns down!

130
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,259
On the floor! Guns down!

131
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,699
Why do you got guns? You police?

132
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,949
- You police?
- No, no, no, they're with me.

133
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,263
Put the guns on the floor!

134
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:03,276
- On the floor.
- Roper, please, Goddamn it, Roper.

135
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,472
Frisky, Tabby,

136
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:05,980
do what he says.

137
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,100
On the floor.

138
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,732
And everyone stay very, very calm.

139
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,379
We're going to do exactly what
this gentleman wants us to do.

140
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,780
And everything is going to be fine.

141
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,517
You are a rich man.

142
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:22,767
Yes, I am a rich man.

143
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,760
I'm going to give you
all the money we have,

144
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:26,460
I'm going to give you wallets, jewellery.

145
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,252
We'll give you anything
in the restaurant till.

146
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,869
And then, you're going to leave. Right?

147
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,846
Jorge, will you check the till, please?

148
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,002
Tell him no alarms.

149
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,502
No alarms, Jorge.

150
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,799
And slowly!

151
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:38,888
Everybody stay very, very calm.

152
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,515
- Dad!
- It's all right, just keep looking at me.

153
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,779
Back off. Back off.

154
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,819
- Tabby, Tabby, Tabby, step back...
- Back off.

155
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,100
He's your boy?

156
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,940
Yes. He's my boy.

157
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,295
Danny, it's fine, just keep
looking at me. It's fine.

158
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
Jewellery.

159
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,589
- Wallets.
- Just give him everything we have.

160
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:57,614
OK.

161
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,261
In the bag!

162
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,700
It's all right, Danny.

163
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,260
That's all? Where is the real money?

164
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,484
That's shit, man!

165
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,060
Where is the rest?!

166
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,414
We can send for some money.

167
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:12,703
- How much do we have, Corks?
- About 100.

168
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,459
There you are, $100,000.

169
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,620
We can have it here in 15 minutes.

170
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,638
All you have to do is let the boy go.

171
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,019
It's all right, Danny. It's all right.

172
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,251
We contact you. We contact you.

173
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:26,453
You bring the money to us.

174
00:10:26,478 --> 00:10:28,057
- We give you back the boy.
- No, no, no.

175
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,368
- No, no!
- We will give you money.

176
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:31,603
We will give you money! But
you have to leave the boy here.

177
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:33,339
- We contact you!
- No, no, no.

178
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,830
On the floor, on the ground!

179
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,030
No. You take me instead!

180
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:37,614
- You don't have to do that!
- Back off!

181
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,900
Down on the ground!
Everybody on the ground!

182
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,059
- Everybody on the ground!
- Dad!

183
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,459
- We contact you.
- Dad!

184
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,779
Dad!

185
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,859
All right, all right, all right...

186
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,259
Stay there or the boy dies.

187
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,585
Dad! Dad!

188
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,675
On the ground. On the ground.

189
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,620
- On the ground. Get down on the floor!
- No, get out! Back off! Shut up!

190
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,438
Who's in there? Who's in there?

191
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:09,766
Good boy. Good boy.

192
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,220
Good boy.

193
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,349
_

194
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:34,592
_

195
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,557
Mr Burr always wanted to
come to the Swiss Alps.

196
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,260
He likes the peace and
quiet, does Mr Burr.

197
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:58,877
You don't?

198
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,619
All this snow and silence
makes me want to scream.

199
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,539
Don't worry, I'm not going to.

200
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,629
OK.

201
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,380
How long have you been together?

202
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,707
20 years, come November.

203
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,179
Wow! Congratulations.

204
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,667
It's marriage, Jonathan.
It's not a state of bliss.

205
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,707
Any children?

206
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,260
First and last.

207
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:26,004
So there's no mention of Cairo on
your professional CV. I checked.

208
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,989
Yeah. I took it off after I left.

209
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,263
Why?

210
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,780
I had to.

211
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,355
So if Roper checked with
Meister's for a biography,

212
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,617
Cairo wouldn't come up?

213
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
No.

214
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,860
What about Freddie Hamid?

215
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,106
To him I was just a man in a uniform.

216
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,180
He never knew my name.

217
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,900
So just a little bit of
airbrushing and you'd be clean?

218
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,300
Clean.

219
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,259
Do you handle cash in
that hotel of yours?

220
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,260
Yeah...

221
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
Sometimes.

222
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,459
I suppose you stole
some of it? Or all of it?

223
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,260
Would anyone notice straight away?

224
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,783
Not if I was clever about it.

225
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,979
Ah, well, luckily you are
clever, Jonathan. 'Cos I checked.

226
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,127
Did you?

227
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,860
Course you did.

228
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,500
Don't get many visitors here, do you?

229
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,780
No.

230
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,340
Oh, T.E. Lawrence...

231
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:36,990
of Arabia.

232
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,740
The lonely genius who
wished only to be a number.

233
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,728
Would you put that back, please?

234
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,952
Whose initials are these?

235
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,259
They're my father's. It's private.

236
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,810
Oh, sorry. I didn't realise
it meant that much to you.

237
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
Yes, you did.

238
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,086
He was undercover in Belfast,
wasn't he, your father?

239
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,406
Yes, he was.

240
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,086
Same regiment as you.

241
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Yeah.

242
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,086
I read that they had to
put his uniform back on

243
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:08,111
before they buried him.

244
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,100
What do you want, Ms Burr?

245
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,220
I want to make you an offer.

246
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,657
Come and work for me...

247
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:20,719
and afterwards when it's all
over, I will look after you.

248
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:23,680
Resettlement, new name, new identity,

249
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:24,775
new life.

250
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,005
An offer to do what?

251
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,660
To bring down Richard Roper.

252
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,186
I've spent ten years of my
life going after that man.

253
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,811
I've had microphones up his arse,

254
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:45,299
I've had GCHQ tapping every bloody e-mail.

255
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,219
I've had a thousand
satellites overflying him

256
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,099
and I can't get close to him.

257
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,255
Do you know why?

258
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,060
Because he's too smart.

259
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,460
But that'll change.

260
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,661
I want to put you inside his operation.

261
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,822
I will give you a legend
as thick as your arm.

262
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,080
You will be in so deep, you'll worry
that you'll never get out of it.

263
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,447
There's not a scrap of
you that won't get used,

264
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,862
there's not an hour that will
go by that you won't be scared.

265
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,370
But you will nail him.

266
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,604
You will nail him for Sophie Alekan.

267
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,259
You will nail him for your country.

268
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,172
And you will nail him for
the man that owned that book.

269
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,164
Or you can go back to the
hotel of non-existence.

270
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:29,206
It's up to you.

271
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,660
I think he's going to do it.

272
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,579
- What do you need?
- I need to give him a criminal history,

273
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,859
something for Roper to find.

274
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,900
It's got to be West Country
and it needs to be real.

275
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,579
I need the Home Office on board.

276
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,260
And I need you to take out at
least three Devon police officers,

277
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,548
take them to lunch, get
them to play the game.

278
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,259
No half measures, then, eh?

279
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,216
And not a word to the River House, Rex.

280
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:02,220
Do you understand me? Not... a... word.

281
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,460
I do hope I'm not about
to regret the soft spot

282
00:16:06,485 --> 00:16:07,965
that I have for you, Angela.

283
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:48,970
_

284
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,220
All right.

285
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,684
This is Rob Singhal, my deputy.

286
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,060
Hello.

287
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,207
You up for it?

288
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,900
You're sure, are you?

289
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Yeah.

290
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,516
Right, well, sit down, have
a cup of tea, for God's sake.

291
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,901
You're making me feel nervous.

292
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:41,446
Thanks.

293
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
No.

294
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,245
All you've said so far is yes.

295
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:53,838
Do you want me to say no?

296
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,212
Well, now would be the moment.

297
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:57,020
Now, or forever hold your peace.

298
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:02,492
Oh, you're too bloody perfect,
Jonathan Pine, that's your trouble.

299
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,985
I don't want you perfect. Go
on, have a biscuit. Eat it.

300
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,940
You are going to put on the
performance of your life.

301
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,785
There is half a psychopath
lurking in there, Jonathan.

302
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,499
I want you to find him and stick to him.

303
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,159
Once you get down to Devon, you
are the world's second worst man,

304
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:26,515
first place already taken.

305
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,915
There is no right or
wrong for you down there.

306
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,806
Do you hear me? It's all me, me, me.

307
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:32,681
Don't give anyone an inch.

308
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:34,717
Anyone pisses you off, you smack them.

309
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,660
Anyone crosses you, God help them.

310
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,202
I want you to scare the
shit out of everyone,

311
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:40,497
and that includes me!

312
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:42,939
Richard Roper must know that
you're in the same league as him.

313
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,780
Laws don't apply to him, and
they don't apply to you, either.

314
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,340
He sees that, we get him,

315
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,845
he comes to the table, we get
him over a barrel, we skewer him!

316
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,280
Are you comfortable with that?

317
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:58,616
Yes.

318
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,357
Right, this is our insurance.

319
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,235
To say that you jumped,
we didn't push you.

320
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,567
Tell me what you saw when
you got to the cottage.

321
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,860
Er, the, the kitchen was a mess...

322
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,100
...and there is blood
on the... on the floor.

323
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,460
Did he kill him?

324
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:57,002
_

325
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
Hi.

326
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,352
You all right?

327
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,984
I've...

328
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,559
taken Rosum's cottage.

329
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,499
I was told to leave the rent here.

330
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:28,623
I'll be here for a while.

331
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,287
Is this your place?

332
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,435
Oh, no, it's my mum's.
I'm just looking after it.

333
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:34,552
Right.

334
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,766
You're from up country?

335
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,420
Yeah, that's right.

336
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:40,438
What you doing down here?

337
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,020
He's a big lad.

338
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,412
Is he yours?

339
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,140
Yeah.

340
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Well...

341
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,209
What was the name?

342
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,100
Jack Linden.

343
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:55,288
- Who are you?
- Get out.

344
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,405
Nobody even lives here!

345
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,648
Well, I do now.

346
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,620
What do you want?

347
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Police, right?

348
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
No.

349
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,020
Whatever you are, get lost.

350
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:03,824
- I've got an offer for you.
- Yeah, well, I'm not interested.

351
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,380
You deaf? I told you to get lost.

352
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:17,124
Now listen to me, OK?

353
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,897
I don't know who you're buying
off, but things have changed.

354
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,162
I have a delivery coming
in a few weeks' time.

355
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,092
You're buying off me now, OK?

356
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,633
Piss off.

357
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,500
I would advise a different
business language from now on.

358
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:41,301
Try it.

359
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,820
Try it.

360
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:46,405
No!

361
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,877
Sh-sh-sh-sh.

362
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Sh-sh-sh-sh.

363
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,892
Who was that?

364
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:11,873
You OK?

365
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,033
Let's try a little
thought experiment here.

366
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:29,111
Take all the things you
own, clothes, house, car,

367
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,499
and ask yourself what part of all that

368
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,734
did not depend on commerce and
the free of movement of capital.

369
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:39,023
For the benefit of the hard
of thinking in the room,

370
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:41,165
I'll give you the answer.
The answer is none.

371
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:43,391
None!

372
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,219
My Safe Haven project for refugees

373
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,139
is not funded out of
love, or a bleeding heart.

374
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,267
I do it because it benefits me

375
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:54,653
to have the communities
in which I wish to operate

376
00:24:54,678 --> 00:24:56,278
sympathetic to my interests.

377
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,420
And the truth, which no-one
dares admit these days...

378
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,886
...is that only by freeing capital

379
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,903
do you free the world.

380
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,124
Right.

381
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,620
Hey.

382
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,980
Pint of Blue Anchor, please.

383
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,980
That's him.

384
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Cheers.

385
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,100
- Hey.
- You all right?

386
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:11,412
Yeah.

387
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,420
My mother says you want mineral water.

388
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,808
Er... I don't think so.

389
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,060
Well, I've brought them now.

390
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Coffee?

391
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,380
I wouldn't say no.

392
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,305
I...

393
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:38,204
...googled you,

394
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,969
Jack Linden.

395
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,891
And what did you find?

396
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,900
Bugger all.

397
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,605
So you like it here, do you?

398
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,644
All on your own.

399
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,527
What do you do here all day?

400
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,020
Bit of cooking.

401
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,787
I can cook.

402
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:05,115
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

403
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:06,349
I was good.

404
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,646
I won prizes. I was
going to be a famous chef.

405
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,940
- Well, what happened?
- I stopped.

406
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,020
Why?

407
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:15,968
Cos I married a loser, had a
brat, and screwed up my life.

408
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,260
Right...

409
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,580
Erm...

410
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,179
- And the father is...?
- No, he isn't.

411
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,500
He ain't been Charlie's father
since he was three days old.

412
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,994
He came to the hospital with a
box of Cadbury's milk chocolates

413
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:29,558
and tuckered all the nice ones.

414
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:31,059
He couldn't wait to flee.

415
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,175
Where to?

416
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,530
Don't ask me.

417
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,074
- Is he abroad or...?
- Tom Quince?!

418
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,027
Say... Sorry, say again?

419
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:43,105
Tom Quince, it's Charlie's father's name.

420
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,100
Nah, he's never had a
passport in his life.

421
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,220
He's probably somewhere round Bude,

422
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:51,805
smoking a ton of pot and trying
to sleep with the weekend talent.

423
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,195
_

424
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,422
It's... It's a great pleasure
to introduce the Chief Officer

425
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,438
at the US Directorate of
Defence Trade Controls,

426
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:55,976
Joel Steadman.

427
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,164
Firstly, gentlemen...

428
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:00,436
- and lady...
- Sorry.

429
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:02,452
...I want to thank you all
for inviting me to London

430
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:05,681
to share a little of what I
know about the global arms trade

431
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:07,586
in the 21st century
and how to confront it.

432
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,819
Now, there's about 3,000
years of wisdom in this room

433
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,459
and I represent about six weeks of it.

434
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,948
But hell, those odds never
stopped an American before.

435
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:18,291
Now there's two philosophies
on how to confront

436
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:19,560
international arms smuggling.

437
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:21,980
You can exploit or you can enforce.

438
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:23,873
Now, I'm an enforcer,
and I'll tell you why.

439
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,580
You go down the exploitation
path, this is what happens.

440
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:28,115
You identify a bad guy,

441
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
you watch him,

442
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,939
get all kinds of dirt on
him, and you approach him.

443
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,053
And then what do you do?

444
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,740
Well, then you recruit him.

445
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,220
You recruit him to get to the
next guy, then you watch him,

446
00:29:38,455 --> 00:29:40,650
and you recruit him,
and so on, and so forth.

447
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,380
And pretty soon the lines get blurred,

448
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:43,884
your enemy becomes your friend,

449
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,028
and hey... the devil has
all the best lines, right?

450
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:49,309
Now I'm an enforcer.

451
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:50,958
I go after someone...

452
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,551
and I bring 'em down,

453
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,583
and the reason why I'm here today

454
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,917
is to ask you folks for a little help.

455
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,899
- Joel.
- Mr Dromgoole.

456
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,539
- Excellent to see you.
- Thank you.

457
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,619
You know these guys?

458
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,660
- Palfrey.
- Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

459
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:11,060
I enjoyed your speech.

460
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,099
Well, let's keep the
channels open at all times.

461
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,659
Absolutely. Particularly when
it comes to the Middle East.

462
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,779
Anything you have at all.

463
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,920
I have money and people
ready to work with you.

464
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:20,315
Sure will, Geoffrey.

465
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,055
- Speak to you guys later.
- Thank you.

466
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:36,981
- Joel.
- Ah!

467
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:38,908
- Good to have you with us.
- Nice to see you.

468
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,751
Angela.

469
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:44,269
Hello, Joel.

470
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:54,659
What do you think of the ale?

471
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,433
Jury's out.

472
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,060
I see, um, you're not drinking.

473
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:02,860
You didn't tell me you were flying in.

474
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,580
You didn't tell me something
a lot more important than that.

475
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,842
Why were you in Madrid two weeks ago?

476
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,234
It's an operation called Limpet.

477
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,406
We're going after Richard Onslow Roper.

478
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:20,060
His people are meeting with
a Spanish lawyer in Madrid.

479
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,797
- Juan Apostol.
- Yeah. Also known as Apo.

480
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,100
We think there's a new
deal in the pipeline.

481
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,850
But you can't get close.

482
00:31:28,874 --> 00:31:30,483
Can anyone?

483
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,713
They're phone records from the
mobile phone of Lance Corkoran.

484
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,939
Roper's front man.

485
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:40,494
They show calls to
London, Beirut and Madrid.

486
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,460
How the hell did you get this?

487
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,998
I've got a new asset.

488
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,537
I want to get him on the
inside of Roper's set-up.

489
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,584
You got any idea how dangerous that is?

490
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,420
Does River House know about this?

491
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,584
It's got to be a church mouse operation.

492
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,460
Why did you call me?

493
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,327
'Cos I need your money.

494
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:06,009
Look...

495
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,408
Joel, I'm on my own in
this, and I don't like it.

496
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,860
I'm doing something no-one else has
done before and I'm scared shitless.

497
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:15,315
I need a friend.

498
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:36,100
I've got some more stuff
coming on Tuesday night.

499
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:37,605
You got the money?

500
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:39,846
Good.

501
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:08,875
Hi.

502
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:10,108
Harlow.

503
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
Right.

504
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,400
From London.

505
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:22,619
Is that what you wanted?

506
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,180
Well...

507
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,541
...yeah.

508
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,913
It's a funny old gig, this one.

509
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,741
I shall expect a lavish funeral.

510
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,311
I'm sure they'll do what they can.

511
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Well, then...

512
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,823
Tom Quince.

513
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:48,576
Are you ready?

514
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,208
We need to wait for the stuff.

515
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:06,411
It'll come and it'll all be OK.

516
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:09,770
Yeah.

517
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:11,739
- It'll be OK.
- It'll be OK.

518
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,540
It's going to be OK.

519
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,794
- Now get out!
- OK! OK! OK!

520
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,020
What?

521
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:33,788
Jack?

522
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,900
Jack?

523
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,580
Tell me what you saw when
you got to the cottage.

524
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:04,764
The kitchen was a mess...

525
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,609
...and there is blood on the floor.

526
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:10,300
There you go.

527
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,784
Did he kill him?

528
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,448
The man he attacked in the pub?

529
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,361
Yes.

530
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:23,346
Why did you go to the cottage?

531
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,908
I was fetching empties.

532
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:26,972
Have you been there before?

533
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,558
Yeah. Once or twice.

534
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:30,618
Why?

535
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,464
To deliver for my mother. That's all.

536
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,550
Did he ever mention his previous life?

537
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,214
- No.
- Ever mention Switzerland?

538
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:40,604
No, why?

539
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,284
Did he say he was leaving?

540
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:43,655
No.

541
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,704
Name Jonathan Pine mean anything to you?

542
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,020
No!

543
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:49,099
So he never told you his real name?

544
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,061
No. He said his name was Linden.

545
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,020
Jack Linden.

546
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,540
He never told you who he was.

547
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,619
No, he never said who he was.

548
00:37:05,716 --> 00:37:08,521
_

549
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,020
Who's in there? Who's in there?

550
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,140
Go. Go back to your mother.

551
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,060
Go.

552
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:43,277
Go!

553
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,587
You bastard.

554
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,035
You were supposed not to hurt him!

555
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,620
It needed to look real.

556
00:37:54,997 --> 00:37:56,214
You want it real?

557
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,008
I'll show you real!

558
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,900
We'll show you real!

559
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,594
- Oh, Jesus, Danny, Danny.
- Just one second. Just wait here.

560
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:23,259
- Let me just see what's going on.
- Danny. Come on, big man.

561
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,875
- Danny. Oh, God, Danny!
- He's all right.

562
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,459
- Are you all right?
- You're... You're OK?

563
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,017
What hap... what happened?

564
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,782
They ran off.

565
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,415
He scared them.

566
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,132
He saved me.

567
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,445
Who saved you? What...

568
00:38:38,797 --> 00:38:40,047
Who is he? Where the hell's he come from?

569
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,976
He's our seasonal sous-chef from England.

570
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,555
He was working in that kitchen.

571
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:47,512
We need to call the police.

572
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,162
Chief, we doing medical attention?

573
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,708
I know him.

574
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,797
What's his name?

575
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,062
Thomas Quince.

576
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:59,352
He is from Devon in England.

577
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:02,711
No, he's bloody not!

578
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,380
You're Pine, from Switzerland.

579
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:09,524
- What are you doing here?
- Sandy, we need to call the police.

580
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:10,948
No police.

581
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,339
No police.

582
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,239
No. Hold on, Jorge.
Just hold on a second.

583
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,860
How's his pulse, Frisky?

584
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,460
Yeah, it's quite sporting,
Chief, all things considered.

585
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:26,664
You hearing me, Pine?

586
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,700
We're going to get you out of here.

587
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:32,891
Corky, get the boats ready, will you?

588
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:34,797
- And call the hospital.
- Which one?

589
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,172
Well, our one, not the
death trap on the main drag.

590
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:39,870
Tell them to get ready to operate,

591
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:41,151
and get a hold of that Israeli fellow.

592
00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:42,487
- What's...
- Dr Shimon?

593
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:45,152
Drag him away from whatever
Russian party he's currently at.

594
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,860
You must have given them
the fright of their lives.

595
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,940
No police.

596
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,220
No police.

597
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,961
Right, Jorge, I think we can
keep this between us, can't we?

598
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,868
I'll pay for any damage
done. Corky can sort the bill.

599
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:04,189
Anyone you want us to call?

600
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,908
A girlfriend? Family?

601
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,740
Still alone, are we?

602
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,460
Well...

603
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,017
...we're going to take care of you.

604
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,491
Thank you.

605
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,620
- Hey.
- Hey!

606
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,878
Any sign of him?

607
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:46,067
- What went wrong?
- Let me get this.

608
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,497
He went off script.

609
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:48,950
Way off script.

610
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,395
Broke an agent's arm in three places.

611
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:52,879
What's he playing at?

612
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,020
He said he wanted it
real. So they made it real.

613
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,560
They think they might have killed him.

614
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,860
What do you mean killed him?

615
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,646
Well, Roper didn't call the cops,
so... we don't know where he is.

616
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,881
Goddamn it, Angela.

617
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:04,794
This thing was perfectly choreographed.

618
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,872
He knew exactly what we had to do.

619
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,019
Hector, do you remember
Angela Burr from Baghdad?

620
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,393
Sure do. Welcome, ma'am.

621
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,924
You two still working together?

622
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:22,299
Yeah. No-one is more
mystified by that than me.

623
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,870
Sir. You should hear this.

624
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:24,735
Come on, sit down.

625
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,699
Corkoran is calling a
number in Gloucestershire

626
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:28,260
from his mobile phone.

627
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,700
Tony? Lance Corkoran here.

628
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:33,945
Pressing matter, I'm afraid.

629
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,788
Chief needs your good offices.

630
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Got a pen?

631
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,544
The name is Pine,

632
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:42,795
like the tree.

633
00:41:43,397 --> 00:41:44,676
First name Jonathan.

634
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,900
Goes under the name of Thomas Quince,

635
00:41:48,982 --> 00:41:50,091
like the fruit.

636
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:53,855
Head-to-toe background check,
all avenues. All perfectly mum.

637
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,020
360 degrees.

638
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,974
Ta.

639
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:59,442
Well, he's alive. They
wouldn't check on a dead man.

640
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,346
Rob Singhal. IEA.

641
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:18,721
Rob. I want you to put his
name out. Splash it large.

642
00:42:18,892 --> 00:42:21,931
I want an international warrant
for the arrest of Thomas Quince,

643
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,198
Jonathan Pine, Jack Linden.

644
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,566
Murder, multiple theft, dope-running,

645
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,220
obtaining a false passport,
and identity theft,

646
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,810
and whatever else you can think of.

647
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,300
All right? Do it now.

648
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,136
- He's crossed the bridge.
- Yeah.

649
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,980
Now we're burning it.

650
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,260
Thomas.

651
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,740
Thomas, I'm not sure if you can hear me.

652
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,757
They say your face is mending well.

653
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,076
You've also cracked several ribs.

654
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,740
You're so brave, but
you're going to be fine.

655
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:39,860
Dr Shimon's the very best,
otherwise Roper wouldn't use him.

656
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,428
Listen. Is there anyone
you want us to call?

657
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,874
A loved one?

658
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,490
When you were sleeping, you
mentioned someone called Sophie.

659
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,834
Should we call her?

660
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,545
Just raise your finger
if you can't speak.

661
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:00,857
Roper is away on business,

662
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:03,282
but he'll be back soon and
he can't wait to see you.

663
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,180
Where... am... I?

664
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,380
Are you awake?

665
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:21,601
My father says I'm to thank
you for saving my life.

666
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:25,062
I'm sorry I ran away from the table.

667
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:27,163
I won't do it again.

668
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:45,698
Do you want me to read
to you about squid?

669
00:45:50,227 --> 00:45:52,977
This slow-moving, alien-like squid

670
00:45:53,195 --> 00:45:56,195
lives at depths of up to 200...

671
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,706
Piss off, would you, Frisky, old love?

672
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,500
Well, that's a better colour.

673
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:27,456
Lovely deep purple.

674
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,651
Better than the blue
baboon look of last week.

675
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,048
And sitting up!

676
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,633
Dare one hope we're on the mend?

677
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,071
Actually, I'd like to go soon, please.

678
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:40,340
Absolutely, old boy, soon
as the Chief gets back.

679
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:44,698
What do I call you, by the way?

680
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:49,526
When I was doing the forms at
the hospital, I had a conundrum.

681
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:51,697
"Well," I thought, "this is a bit rum.

682
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,775
"Is he a Thomas Quince,

683
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,923
"or is he a Jonathan Pine?"

684
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:58,602
So I put Mordechai Phillips.

685
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:01,358
To this day, I've no idea why.

686
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,514
Mind if I smoke?

687
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:08,453
Smoke ourselves, do we? In better times?

688
00:47:08,854 --> 00:47:09,992
A bit.

689
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,940
Nothing like a fag when you're cooking.

690
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,026
Do you want one now?

691
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:22,060
No, thanks.

692
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,297
Bloody good grub at that
place you were working.

693
00:47:25,782 --> 00:47:28,711
Were those saucy mussels all your work?

694
00:47:30,922 --> 00:47:33,300
Well, I am blown away.

695
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:36,453
And did you cook at
that Swiss hotel? Or...

696
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:38,792
merely rob the place?

697
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,235
It's a tricky one, you see.

698
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:45,275
The Chief is a stickler for details,

699
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,899
so we called the Meister's
Hotel to ask for a reference,

700
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,808
and it turns out you are
nothing more than a common thief.

701
00:47:54,198 --> 00:47:56,761
40,000 euros swiped from the safe,

702
00:47:56,823 --> 00:47:58,180
the police called,

703
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,935
Herr Meister's positively seething.

704
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,059
No wonder the Chief has
a few questions to ask.

705
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:07,950
But he says they can
wait until you're better.

706
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,900
Although, I'm not so sure we're
quite as poorly as we're making out.

707
00:48:16,162 --> 00:48:17,202
In fact,

708
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:20,773
I'm not sure at all about you, Pine.

709
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,980
I think you might be stringing us along.

710
00:48:29,094 --> 00:48:32,257
And if that's the case,
when you're better,

711
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,057
I will hood you,

712
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:37,705
and hang you up by those lovely ankles

713
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:40,580
until the truth falls out of you

714
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,197
by gravity.

715
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:47,865
Toodle-oo.

716
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,983
Frisky, piss off back
in again, would you?

717
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:55,217
Make sure our valued guest
doesn't try and make a run for it.

718
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,032
You know the best way
to make a bloke talk?

719
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,900
Fizzy drink treatment.

720
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,345
Up the nose.

721
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:08,993
Bung the mouth.

722
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:11,940
And if you've got a funnel handy...

723
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:13,660
Oh, it's even better.

724
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:16,815
Hits you right in the switchboard.

725
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,305
It's bloody diabolical.

726
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,982
_

727
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:39,024
Apo, how are you?

728
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,321
- Good to see you.
- Very good to see you.

729
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,054
- Have a seat.
- Thank you very much.

730
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:44,835
So have you eaten?

731
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:10,987
_

732
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:14,792
You sure you know your lines?

733
00:50:16,103 --> 00:50:17,394
I'll do my best.

734
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,159
So, tell us about Limpet.

735
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,177
Well, Limpet's an ongoing anti-arms
operation based in Washington.

736
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,599
Standard tracer op. It's
been running about a year.

737
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:27,974
Who are you going after?

738
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:29,443
Richard Onslow Roper.

739
00:50:29,615 --> 00:50:32,258
Director of Iron Last, and we
think a lot more on the side.

740
00:50:32,482 --> 00:50:33,740
That wouldn't surprise me.

741
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:35,819
I came here to see if
there were opportunities

742
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,141
for mutual collaboration
and intelligence sharing.

743
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,979
Angela was happy to come on board,

744
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,599
and I was hoping you folks
would kind of do the same.

745
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,106
All right. Where are
you at at the moment?

746
00:50:46,278 --> 00:50:47,669
Well, it's been going pretty well,

747
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,145
- wouldn't you say?
- Yeah.

748
00:50:49,364 --> 00:50:51,408
Erm, we have some
photographs here of a meeting

749
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:54,625
that took place in Madrid,
between an Alexander Langbourne,

750
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,393
Roper's money man, and a
Spanish lawyer, Juan Apostol.

751
00:50:57,955 --> 00:51:00,275
It's possible they were
discussing a future arms deal.

752
00:51:01,283 --> 00:51:02,539
Did you get any audio on that?

753
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:03,892
Unfortunately not, no.

754
00:51:03,986 --> 00:51:05,939
So it's possible they were discussing

755
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,658
their children's Christmas parties!

756
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:11,981
What about on the ground?

757
00:51:12,148 --> 00:51:13,715
Got anyone close to Roper?

758
00:51:14,348 --> 00:51:16,008
Er, not right now, no...

759
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:17,812
In development?

760
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:21,099
You know, getting someone on the
inside, Harry, that's a long game.

761
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,500
- What I want from you guys...
- Let me stop you there, Joel.

762
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,059
Angela runs her own
modest enforcement agency

763
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,580
and she can do what she likes.

764
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,220
Roper is an obsession of hers,

765
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:32,220
he was when she was with
us here at the River,

766
00:51:32,245 --> 00:51:34,034
I suspect that he always will be,

767
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:34,939
but I hope you understand

768
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:37,284
that I can't spend the
nation's intelligence budget

769
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,495
on an operation whose
current status appears...

770
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,291
to be somewhat catatonic.

771
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,182
I would need a little more.

772
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,057
Right, that's...

773
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,278
that's disappointing.

774
00:51:48,403 --> 00:51:49,872
Life's disappointing, Joel.

775
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:51,987
Just ask Angela.

776
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:56,995
Please, come back when
you have something.

777
00:51:57,222 --> 00:51:58,800
OK? Our door is always open.

778
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,601
- Was that dull enough for you?
- Oh, are you kidding me?

779
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,295
I never knew an American could sound
so much like a total bloody loser.

780
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,435
How do you stand it, Angela?
"Modest enforcement agency."

781
00:52:18,582 --> 00:52:20,129
- God!
- Well, he's not wrong, is he?

782
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,653
But they must never
know about our boy, Joel.

783
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:26,059
No mention of him in comms, nothing
written down, nothing at all, yeah?

784
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,718
We keep River House on the outside.

785
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:29,813
It's too dangerous.

786
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,928
- Daddy! I caught a lobster!
- Oh, my goodness!

787
00:53:15,212 --> 00:53:17,725
- You caught that? Oh, yeah!
- Javier helped me.

788
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,186
- Did he? Good for him. Good for you.
- Yeah.

789
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,659
Hello, darling. How are you?

790
00:53:21,683 --> 00:53:23,683
- Well done, Danny. Well done.
- Hi!

791
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,460
How is the patient?

792
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:00,380
You sleep now.

793
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:03,217
Tomorrow, we'll find
out who you really are.
